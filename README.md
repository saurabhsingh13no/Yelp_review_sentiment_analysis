# Yelp review sentiment analysis
Project analysis sentiment associated with reviews of restaurant on Yelp.


## About

In this post, we will be training a LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Network), which is a type of RNN to classify text data from Yelp reviews. During this project, Goal of this project is to show how to Train a LSTM, and how to Tune the model to reduce variance and obtain higher accuracy on Validation data.


## Approach

Took the following approach to achieve our goal :

* Preparing the data for learning
* Defining the model and training it
* Tuning the model and removing variance

## Data

Used *Yelp Dataset*. It contains user reviews for millions of local businesses, along with a star rating that user gave the business. As an example, here are a few examples from the data:
